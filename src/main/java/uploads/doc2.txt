The proofs of these identities
are probably even more significant than the identities themselves. They
will consist of showing that both sides of a given equation count the same
kind of objects; they just do it in two different ways. Therefore, the two expressions must be equal to each other. This type of argument is the dream
of most combinatorialists when they prove identities.
